# React-based-todos-site
This is a react based "todos" web application, here I have used route handleling to go from one page to another page and some basic features of this site are 
here you can add  todos with a title and a description and can delete it whenever you want and as the todos get stored in your local storage, even after reloading the 
todos not gonna be removed.
